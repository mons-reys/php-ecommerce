== Description

This project is a Simple PHP ECommerce Web App 

== Main page

Simple page with some text in the middle, a footer with the licence and some text.
On the header you have the logo and the web site name, a search bar in the middle, 
a notification and a profile icon on the right.

== Website structure

  +--index.php

In the `index.php` file we instanciate the Router and run it. 

  $router = new Router($config);
  $router->routerQuery();

On the first arrival on the application, the Router will render one file page `MainView`.

  $view = new View("Main");
  $view->render([]);

The View will render the `HeaderView`, the `MainView`, and then render the `TemplateView` 
with the `HeaderView` and the `MainView` to fill in the template.

For a specific request, the Router will use either the `$_QUERY['action']` or the `$_POST['action']` variable
to find out which controller has to be called. 
The Controller will call the nedeed Model(s) to save (for the register part), check (for the login) or retreive (for the catalog) 
the data from the database. It will, then call the View associated giving it the data to render the page.

== Authentication

=== Objects

The Authentication is made by the `UserModel.php`.

=== Database tables

There is one Database table used for this feature: `user`. 

=== Functionalities

=== Routing

In the Router there are three actions for the Authentication:

[NOTE]
====
To fill the Avatar `select` on the register page, we read all **PNG** files in the `img/avatar/` directory.

You should download a set on internet and unzip it in this directory. 

__I suggest the wonderfull {avatar-website}[deleket] set.__

or host yourself the third libraries used in this website, all you hav to is to download the following libraries in the `libs` folder:

  |
  +--libs
     +--fonts
     │  +--roboto
     |        LICENSE.txt
     |        Roboto-Black.ttf
     |        Roboto-BlackItalic.ttf
     |        Roboto-Bold.ttf
     |        Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf
     |        Roboto-Italic.ttf
     |        Roboto-Light.ttf
     |        Roboto-LightItalic.ttf
     |        Roboto-Medium.ttf
     |        Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf
     |        Roboto-Regular.ttf
     |        Roboto-Thin.ttf
     |        Roboto-ThinItalic.ttf

     |        jquery-3.2.1.min.js
     +--materialicons
     │  +--v33
     |        2fcrYFNaTjcS6g4U3t-Y5ZjZjT5FdEJ140U2DJYC3mY.woff2
     |        icon.css
     +--materialize
